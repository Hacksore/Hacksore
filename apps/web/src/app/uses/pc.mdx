Here are some specific things I use when working on my PC but most of the time it's just for gaming.


### PC Software
Currently use <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces" target="_blank">Github Codespaces</a> when on windows because developing on windows sucks and WSL is not that great. 
I've setup a codespace that I can ssh into and get my same neovim setup, just one command `gh cs ssh` and I'm in.

### PC Hardware
My new gaming rig is a ASUS Zephyrus M16, it allows me to take my gaming PC with me when I travel.
