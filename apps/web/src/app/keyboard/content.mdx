# Why do I use an "ergonomic" keyboard? 

- 💀 So I don't die of wrist/shoulder pain when I'm old
- 🎨 It looks badass and is very comfortable 
- ☕ Coffee in the middle for quick access
- 🐁 Trackpad in the middle for those sweet gestures
- ⌨️  Better for vim™ (source: trust me bro)
- 🧑‍💻 Great community & software

You can track my [Moonlander layout](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/Qj4BD/latest/0) if you'd like to see what I've changed but for the most part I've kept it pretty stock OEM.

#### day1 (4/20/23)

This is hard, slow typing like 4wpm. Programming is not possible without looking at the keyboard legend.

#### day2 (4/21/23)

Today I was able to hit peak speed of 55wpm without symbols or capitalization [typingclub](https://typingclub.com)

#### day12 (5/03/23)
Took a vacation but was able to float around 50wpm and getting better at coding.

#### day12 (5/04/23)
Right off the rip I got a 61wpm on [typingclub](https://typingclub.com), though programming is still rather challenging but making good progress.

#### day14 (5/06/23)
Spent a few hours programming and I'm getting more effiecent at finding the symbol keys in the left side of the keyboard.

#### day23 (5/15/23)
Every change on this website since 4/20/23 has been with the moonlander. I've gotten more comfortable with the custom symbols but it is rather stange when I got back to a normal staggared keyboard and try to type 😅.

#### day56 (6/17/23)
Typing around 60wpm now conistently, still make a bunch of mistakes but I try to revist [typingclub](https://typingclub.com) to hone my skillz.
